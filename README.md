# Bond Court: Court Watching Data 2022-01-15 to 2022-03-06
*By Micah Clark Moody*

This data was collected by Micah Clark Moody through regular courtwatching from 2022-01-15 to 2022-03-06. There are also sporadic later dates (2022-04-21). This repository is a summary of case information and pretrial release decisions in bond court. These decisions reflect the ruling of the first judgeto receive a case, with 24 to 72 hours of arrest. These decisions do not reflect pretrial conditions over an entire case because conditions can be changed by judges after bond court.

This repository is version-controlled and backed up to GitHub, accessible at [this link](https://github.com/MicahCM/bond_court).
