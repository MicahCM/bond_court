### This project

In anticipation of the _Pretrial Fairness Act_ abolition of bail on January 1, 2023, I set out to observe bond court and interview lawyers working there. the project evolved to argue ***increase in pretrial incarceration without bail is a potential consequence of abolishing bond which requires procedural intervention in addition to legal safeguards.*** To reach this conclusion, I have built on the work of the _Coalition to End Money Bond_ and _Appleseed Center for Fair Court's_ excellent 2017 court watching effort and analysis of a policy change that diminished the use of bond. To develop context on the current bond court process, I conducted qualitative analysis and interviews in addition to this quantitative overview.
